Photo credit should read: Andrew Milligan/PA Wire\\nOn Saturday, The Scotsman revealed warnings by the Scottish Police Federation that services may be reduced or policing cuts made due to the burden of dealing with controversial new hate crime legislation. David Threadgold, chair of the Scottish Police Federation, said overtime payments for control room staff will have \"consequences\", warning that \\'at some point in the next financial year the police service will not do something because of the demand that it\\'s being placed under now\".\\nThe Scottish Government said Police Scotland received \\'record\\' funding of £1.55 billion for 2024/25, an increase of £92.7 million. But the latest edition of justice publication 1919 Magazine, highlights fears that the force is becoming \\'increasingly reactive, not proactive\\'.\\nThe Conservatives have claimed that the Scottish Government has allowed a \\'perfect storm\\' for organised crime by what the party claims is underfunding of Police Scotland.\\nMr Kennedy said: \\'Community policing is the cornerstone of the police service. The bottom line is the intelligence on organised crime groups (OCGs) and terrorism comes from the communities.\\nWarnings have been issued that Police Scotland officers will struggle to obtain intelligence relating to organised crime and terrorism due to cutbacks (Picture: Andrew Milligan/PA)\\n\\'If you don\\'t have community police officers out there patrolling and picking up on that intelligence, then they\\'re missing out on so much.\\n\\'We\\'re finding OCGs coming in from far away, entering communities, knowing there\\'s no police, and actually setting up whatever they want to do knowing that nobody knows.\\n\\'There\\'s nobody knocking on the door. Or even saying ‘how are you doing?\\' It\\'s basics and we are totally missing out on that.

And then what will happen is maybe not today, but five or 10 years\\' time, we\\'re going to have really bad criminals within Scotland.\\'\\nScottish Conservative MSP Murdo Fraser, said that police officers have correctly highlighted \\'the perfect storm that the SNP have created due to years of shamefully neglecting Scottish policing, coupled with the absurd new Hate Crime Act\\', which critics have warned is putting even more strain on services.\\nHe added: \\'It stands to reason that organised crime will flourish and the threat of extremism grow if officer numbers are at their lowest level since 2008 and police stations are closing up and down Scotland.\\n\\'These brutal cuts have forced the police to abandon investigating certain crimes at the same time as they are being deluged with thousands of fresh complaints – many of them spurious or vexatious – under the reckless Hate Crime Act.\\n\\'SNP ministers are reaping what they sowed – and all of Scotland is suffering as a result.

As chief constable, entrusted with significant public funding, I have a duty to ensure I maximise the number of experienced officers available to the frontline through the right investment in non-warranted support.\\n\\'So we will carefully examine which roles can and should be done by police staff, enabling a wider range of people access to a policing career and allowing even more of our officers to return to frontline and operational policing roles.\\nAdvertisement\\nHide Ad\\nAdvertisement\\nHide Ad\\n\\'Our aim is – must be - to bring the frontline of Scottish policing to the strongest position possible within the resources available.', 'word_count': 1085, 'is_opinion': False, 'twitter_account': '@TheScotsman', 'all_links': ['https://www.nationalworldplc.com/', 'https://www.scotsmanconferences.com/', 'https://www.connect-local.co.uk/?ref=TSN&utm_source=scotsman&utm_medium=news-site-referral&utm_content=navbar&utm_campaign=LDFE-0177%20Inbound%20Leads', 'https://www.facebook.com/TheScotsmanNewspaper', 'https://1919magazine.co.uk/', 'https://www.jpimediaevents.co.uk/', 'https://www.connect-local.co.uk/?ref=TSN&utm_source=scotsman&utm_medium=news-site-referral&utm_content=full-nav&utm_campaign=LDFE-0177%20Inbound%20Leads', 'https://digiadmanager.nationalworld.com/?ref=TSN&utm_source=scotsman&utm_medium=news-site-referral&utm_content=footer&utm_campaign=LDFE-0177%20Inbound%20Leads', 'https://twitter.com/TheScotsman', 'https://www.jobstoday.co.uk/scotland', 'https://www.nationalworld.com/culture/television/coronation-street-star-leaving-for-new-life-abroad-4583567?itm_source=Internal&itm_channel=section_banner&itm_campaign=breaking-news-ticker&itm_content=3', 'https://www.nationalworld.com/business/ted-baker-closure-11-stores-to-be-shut-as-fashion-retailer-enters-administration-full-list-4583269?itm_source=Internal&itm_channel=section_banner&itm_campaign=breaking-news-ticker&itm_content=5', 'https://www.connect-local.co.uk/self-serve/?ref=TSN&utm_source=scotsman&utm_medium=news-site-referral&utm_content=place-your-ad&utm_campaign=LDFE-0177%20Inbound%20Leads', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-scotsman/', 'https://nationalworld.newsprints.co.uk/', 'https://www.nationalworld.com/culture/celebrity/rush-hour-actor-jackie-chan-shares-health-update-amid-concerns-from-fans-ahead-of-70th-birthday-4583934?itm_source=Internal&itm_channel=section_banner&itm_campaign=breaking-news-ticker&itm_content=1', 'http://www.shotstv.com/', 'https://www.nationalworld.com/culture/music/country-singer-morgan-wallen-arrested-for-allegedly-throwing-a-chair-from-a-rooftop-bar-4583384?itm_source=Internal&itm_channel=section_banner&itm_campaign=breaking-news-ticker&itm_content=4', 'https://policies.google.com/privacy', 'https://www.connect-local.co.uk/public-legal-notices/?ref=tsn', 'https://publicnoticeportal.uk/the-scotsman', 'https://policies.google.com/terms', 'https://www.nationalworld.com/news/people/garry-van-egmond-legendary-australian-music-promoter-known-for-sold-out-acdc-concerts-dies-aged-82-4583478?itm_source=Internal&itm_channel=section_banner&itm_campaign=breaking-news-ticker&itm_content=2', 'https://www.instagram.com/the.scotsman/', 'https://www.connect-local.co.uk/?ref=TSN&utm_source=scotsman&utm_medium=news-site-referral&utm_content=footer&utm_campaign=LDFE-0177%20Inbound%20Leads', 'http://www.jpimedialocal.co.uk/?ref=TSN&utm_source=scotsman&utm_medium=news-site-referral&utm_content=top-nav&utm_campaign=LDFE-0177%20Inbound%20Leads', 'https://connect-local.co.uk/family-announcements/?ref=tsn', 'https://digitaladmanager.nationalworld.com/', 'https://www.jobstoday.co.uk/recruiters', 'https://www.instagram.com/the.scotsman', 'https://www.nationalworld.com/culture/television/emmerdale-tv-tuesday-evening-4583156?itm_source=Internal&itm_channel=section_banner&itm_campaign=breaking-news-ticker&itm_content=6', 'https://britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/titles/the-scotsman'], 'all_domain_links': ['instagram.com', 'connect-local.co.uk', 'jpimedialocal.co.uk', 'newsprints.co.uk', 'linkedin.com', 'nationalworldplc.com', 'facebook.com', 'jpimediaevents.co.uk', 'nationalworld.com', '1919magazine.co.uk', 'jobstoday.co.uk', 'britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk', 'twitter.com', 'google.com', 'scotsmanconferences.com', 'shotstv.com', 'publicnoticeportal.uk'], 'id': '2981394288fd77210251c4389dfc8405', 'score': 27.264101}\n",

The PCC is responsible for overseeing the work of Wiltshire Police, holding the Chief Constable to account and commissioning key services for community safety and victim support. After the 2021 election saw a turnout of only 16.63% across the county, the candidates are hoping to convince residents of the importance of their vote. Without local elections to participate in this year, it is a chance for Wiltshire to have its say on an important role within the county. When asked why people should turn up and vote, the four confirmed candidates gave the following comments. The current PCC, Conservative Philip Wilkinson, said: \\'The PCC election is unique and brings democratic control of the police to a county level. \\'The PCC, after consultation with residents, and on their behalf, sets the strategic direction and objectives of the force through the Police and Crime Plan and can, and should hold the Chief Constable to account for the force\\'s officers and staff for the cost-effective and efficient delivery of the priorities set in that plan; and if the police do not deliver to a level of professional competence that the residents have every right to expect and demand, the PCC can remove the Chief Constable.\\' Meanwhile, Independent candidate Mike Rees, said: \\'This role should not be political. \\'Policing should be influenced by the local community and not by politicians and their agendas. \\'As an independent I will work for the people of Wiltshire and not for any political party. \\'My record shows that I make things happen and I will let the public know how things really are with no spin. \\'Politics has decimated policing and your policing response. \\'If you want to make a positive difference you need to vote on May 2 for something different, otherwise things won\\'t change.\\' The Labour and Co-operative Party candidate, Stanka Adamcova, said: \\'Elections are a choice between the future and the past and these elections will be decided by a few votes! \\'Your vote can help Wiltshire and Swindon to have the first-ever Labour and Co-operative Police and Crime Commissioner. \\'It will be transformative for Wiltshire to have a Labour and Co-operative PCC as Labour are the government in waiting. \\'After 14 years of Conservative disastrous decisions for policing commencing with axing 20,000 police officers, a vote for me is a vote for a return to effective policing.\\' Liberal Democrat Alan Hagger said: \"Policing affects us all - whether you have been a victim of crime or whether you just want to feel safe going about your daily life. \\'The only way for you to influence what service you will get from your local police is to use your vote in the PCC elections. \\'With your vote you decide which priorities the police will focus on, how visible and accessible they are, how well victims are supported, and how well the police will work with residents and other organisations to keep you and your family safe. \\'Make your views known, use your vote!\\' The vote will be held on Thursday, May 2, and will determine the county\\'s PCC for the next four-year term. The location of the polling stations will be indicated on the poll cards and voters will require a photo ID.\\nThe election will be held on Thursday, May 2, 2024.

In the running on May 2 are Lisa Townsend (the current PCC and Conservative), Paul Gilbert Kennedy (Liberal Democrat), Kate Chinn ( Labour ) and Alex Coley (Independent).\\nThe PCC role oversees the work of Surrey Police and its Chief Constable and holds them and their decisions to account. They set the strategic direction and aims for the Force through the Police and Crime Plan. Salaries of the PCC are decided on a national basis and vary depending on the size of the force; the commissioner for Surrey will receive a salary of £73,000 per annum.\\nPCCs are also responsible for all funding relating to policing, including the police precept, and to work with the Chief Constable to set the force budget in line with priorities and deliver value for money for residents. Providing a link between the police and Surrey residents, the PCC listens to the public's concerns and works with the Chief Constable to create improvements.\\nLisa Townsend, Conservative Lisa Townsend has been voted in as the new Police and Crime Commissioner for Surrey for the next three years (Image: Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner for Surrey) Looking to get a second term, one of Lisa's major flagships is campaigning to end violence against women and girls. She has been working on various community projects including Safer Streets tackling anti-social behaviour and support services for victims.\\nIn a post on X, formerly Twitter, Lisa said her immediate priorities are maintaining and growing the police force, as well as working with the Chief Constable on ‘back to basics' policing. She said this includes 'ensuring Surrey Police do what only they can: investigating and solving crime, not sitting in hospitals.'\\nAlex Coley, Independent Previously a Digital Lead for the Met Police, Alex said he wants 'more bobbies on the beat' in Surrey. Headline policies include petitioning to parliament to change the way police funding is allocated in the country; Surrey taxpayers contribute more towards policing than the government.\\nSince 2018 Alex has been an Epsom and Ewell councillor as well as chairing the Crime and Disorder panel for the borough. The only independent candidate, Alex is campaigning to 'take party politics out of policing' and put 'pride and professionalism back into Surrey Police'.\\nSONY DSC Paul Gilbert Kennedy, Liberal Democrat Hoping to be third-time lucky is Paul- a former barrister, accountant, actuary and Mole Valley councillor. Some of his campaign policies include 'bringing back community policing' and combatting offending behaviour through restorative justice, education and support for mental health and addictions.\\nIn a press statement, Paul said: 'Like many people I disagree with the idea of PCCs, but we're stuck with them for now. So, let's do the job properly.' If elected, Paul said he will work with the Chief Constable to fix the issues highlighted in the December 2023 inspection report.\\nPaul Kennedy, Liberal Democrat candidate for Surrey PCC (Image: Liberal Democrats) Kate Chinn, Labour Councillor for Epsom and Ewell, Kate's policies include refocusing on neighbourhood-based policing and using empty shops in the town centre for a police presence. Preventative measures is another concern as Kate aims to increase support services for young people.\\nIn a press statement, Kate said: 'I will not flinch from some plain messages about police ethics and behaviour.' She cited recent stories about police misconduct which has 'compromised' the public's reputation of the police. Kate said she wants to review current training to ensure police have a good understanding of domestic violence, misogyny and sexual assault.\\nKate Chinn Voting More information on each candidate will be available on the website www.choosemypcc.org.uk from 10 April, including candidate photos and campaign statements.\\nThe deadline to register to vote is April 16, which can be done online.

(Image: Alan Hagger) The Liberal Democrat candidate for the Wiltshire and Swindon Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) election has said his biggest priority is to 'restore community policing.' Alan Hagger was Head of Strategic Commissioning for three Hampshire Police and Crime Commissioners since 2013 and is now standing to be the PCC in the county-wide elections taking place on May 2. Having previously worked as a social worker and with SEND children in London and Hampshire, he described living in Wiltshire as 'an absolute pleasure.' As a councillor on Amesbury Town Council, he said: 'Being a town councillor has introduced me to parts of Amesbury I didn't know existed and people that I didn't know, and all sorts of things. 'It's a wonderful community.' Mr Hagger recognised the PCC role as 'hugely demanding' and noted that it required balancing 'national context with local needs and delivery.' With regard to Wiltshire Police remaining under special measures, he said: 'We should not be in the position whereby we are receiving such a poor report of performance and hoping to climb out to the point where we are actually trusted to manage our own police force. 'I know that the current Chief Constable and the Police and Crime Commissioner have made progress, and I would want to build on that progress and broaden out.' The candidate listed his 'biggest priority' as community policing. He said: 'I would like a new police strategy whereby you have that visibility and accessibility of police in town centres, where everyone knows that they are there and everyone can go and report crimes or whatever it is that they need to talk to the police about.' Mr Hagger also insisted upon the importance of 'right person, right care' approach, such as mental health agencies as first responders when appropriate. He explained: 'At the moment, the police have to go out every single time, even where there is no danger and no necessity for a policing intervention. 'By making sure that the right people are there to go and intervene at that time, it frees up a lot of police time.' He said that he would also focus on crime prevention, tackling the 'epidemic' of abuse against women and girls, maximising investment for all victims of crime, and improving support for police officers. Mr Hagger highlighted concerns over the antisocial behaviour affecting 'huge numbers of people' and making them 'feel unsafe in their own area.' Supporting voluntary organisations working with young people and finding solutions to the 'environment in which antisocial behaviour happens' were among his suggestions. He added: 'There are a range of issues in Swindon that I would like to make sure are addressed, around burglaries, around knife crime, around anti-social behaviour…' Mr Hagger described wanting to work with other PCCs to collaborate on the issue of delivering a police force over 'sparsely populated areas.'

He said: 'I want to have ongoing discussions with town councils and I would build in a communications infrastructure with town councils and parish councils and local communities to make sure that we were aware of local problems. 'I would make a special emphasis on that happening so that we are responding to the needs of people, that the PCC is on the side of the people and making sure that they get the solutions that they need.'

(Image: Alan Hagger) The Liberal Democrat candidate for the Wiltshire and Swindon Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) election has said his biggest priority is to 'restore community policing.' Alan Hagger was Head of Strategic Commissioning for three Hampshire Police and Crime Commissioners since 2013 and is now standing to be the PCC in the county-wide elections taking place on May 2. Having previously worked as a social worker and with SEND children in London and Hampshire, he described living in Wiltshire as 'an absolute pleasure.' As a councillor on Amesbury Town Council, he said: 'Being a town councillor has introduced me to parts of Amesbury I didn't know existed and people that I didn't know, and all sorts of things. 'It's a wonderful community.' Mr Hagger recognised the PCC role as 'hugely demanding' and noted that it required balancing 'national context with local needs and delivery.' With regard to Wiltshire Police remaining under special measures, he said: 'We should not be in the position whereby we are receiving such a poor report of performance and hoping to climb out to the point where we are actually trusted to manage our own police force. 'I know that the current Chief Constable and the Police and Crime Commissioner have made progress, and I would want to build on that progress and broaden out.' The candidate listed his 'biggest priority' as community policing.

Since Covid we've seen increases in car crime, and in rural crime, and often the best way of catching those criminals is when they're on the roads.\\n'We've put response teams back in the local areas, and response times have been good despite the fact that demand has increased quite dramatically in the last two or three years. Now that response is in a better place, neighbourhood officers will have more time to build relationships with residents and community organisations.\\n'I think people are getting good value for money with the fire and rescue service. We've not been under pressure to close stations or cut jobs, which isn't the case in other parts of the country. With Staffordshire Police, I will be looking to invest in things like new technology to stay ahead of the criminals.'\\nMr Adams added that he was confident that Staffordshire Police would be taken out of special measures in May.\\nMr Sandiford is a borough councillor in Stafford, and has also been selected as the Lib Dem parliamentary candidate for Stoke-on-Trent South at the next general election. He believes there needs to be more face-to-face contact between officers and residents.\\nMr Sandiford said: 'One of my priorities would be a return to good old-fashioned community policing – more police officers on the street, with crimes being dealt with and investigated. As a borough councillor I am well aware of the rise in burglaries, car thefts and anti-social behaviour. But many residents tell me the same thing: that when they report a crime, they're not spoken to by an officer. Some say they don't even see the point in reporting crimes.\\n'Another issue is the fact that Staffordshire Police is one of only six in the country that is currently in special measures. That has happened under the current commissioner's watch, and is a failure. I don't think voters should reward that.\\n'As commissioner I would work with local authorities to get more funding for community policing in Staffordshire. The number of officers in Staffordshire is still down on 2010.'\\nMr Watson has been a Labour Stoke-on-Trent city councillor since 2011, and currently serves as cabinet member for financial sustainability and corporate resources. His pledges include making police officers more visible, tackling drugs and violence against women, and support for fire officers to adapt to changing demands.\\nHe said: 'We need to maximise the visibility of police officers, whether that is through things such as mobile units or town centre patrols. We can also do this by reducing the administrative burden on officers.\\n'I will be tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime. Policing can be proactive, reactive or responsive, but my personal preference is preventative policing. I will champion prevention wherever possible, and support tougher action and sentencing for offenders. I am also pledging to tackle the tragedy of violence against women and girls, and clamp down on drugs and drug dealing, which is a real problem for our communities – particularly when it comes to hard drugs, but even softer drugs aren't that soft.\\n'We are still hundreds of police officers down on where we were before austerity. The officer and PCSOs who have been recruited recently are still learning the role, so some of their time has to be devoted to training, as you would expect. So we would be in a much better place now if it hadn't been for those austerity cuts to policing.'\\nThe commissioner is responsible for setting the police and fire and rescue budgets, which includes setting council tax precepts. This year the two budgets add up to a £314.8 million. Band D households in Stoke-on-Trent or Staffordshire are currently charged a policing council tax precept of £273.57 a year, and a fire precept of £86.77 a year.\\nThe commissioner is also responsible for appointing Staffordshire's chief constable and chief fire officer, and for holding them to account for the performance of their services. They set the policing and fire and rescue objectives, and commission services to reduce crime and support victims, but they are not permitted to interfere with operational matters.\\nStaffordshire Police had 1,964 officers in March 2023, up from 1,832 the previous year, but still down on the 2,315 officers the force had in 2007. Figures for 2023 show that crime overall was up 11 per cent on 2019/20, while anti-social behaviour was 47 per cent down.\", 'word_count': 997, 'is_opinion': False, 'twitter_account': None, 'all_links': ['https://www.mnadigital.co.uk/', 'https://www.mnamedia.co.uk/privacy-policy/', 'https://starjobsearch.co.uk/jobs/', 'https://www.mnamedia.co.uk/acceptable-use-policy/', 'https://directory.expressandstar.co.uk/', 'https://www.mnamedia.co.uk/terms-of-website-use/', 'https://twitter.com/expressandstar', 'https://www.shotstv.com', 'https://www.myfamilyannouncements.co.uk/expressandstar', 'https://www.facebook.com/expressandstar', 'https://bookanad.expressandstar.co.uk/selfservice/home', 'https://www.mnamedia.co.uk/data-protection-policy/', 'http://classifiedads.expressandstar.co.uk/'], 'all_domain_links': ['facebook.com', 'expressandstar.co.uk', 'shotstv.com', 'mnadigital.co.uk', 'myfamilyannouncements.co.uk', 'mnamedia.co.uk', 'starjobsearch.co.uk', 'twitter.com'], 'id': 'a3e04811be82ac8b33cc06d545846f6e', 'score': 25.98096}\n",

If you vote for me as the Labour and Co-operative party's candidate, I will: Deliver effective neighbourhood policing\\nFight the epidemic of knife crime\\nVision ‘Zero Approach' to road safety to eliminate all road fatalities and serious injuries\\nCombat violence against women and girls\\nStand up for rural communities\\nReduce retail crime and anti-social behaviour I came to England in 2009 and wanted to give something back to this country that is now my home. I grew up in a village in Slovakia, where my father has a farm and my mother served as a local Councillor. My parents taught me the values of hard work, humility and honesty and they have formed my sense of duty and my moral compass. My vision is to build a better future for our children and grandchildren and make our communities safe. I want our communities to rely on the police service again. When I speak to you about crime and policing, I often hear the question 'What is the point of calling the police?'. After 12 years of Conservatives, trust in police is at its lowest levels. Vote for me on May 2nd as your next Police and Crime Commissioner and I will restore trust in our police service, by working with the Chief Constable, holding her to account and ensuring that Wiltshire Police is taken out of special measures. I welcome Labour's national commitment to recruit a further 13,000 neighbourhood officers. I will fight to ensure Wiltshire Police gets its fair share of additional officers.

Not being involved with political party nonsense makes me much more qualified to honestly represent the best interests of the people of the Thames Valley than the three main party candidates.\\nWhy should people vote for you?\\nWhy should people vote for you? We need more police officers in our local area, we need the office of the PCC to stop wasting your council tax payments, and we need politics out of policing.\\nWhich crimes will you prioritise?\\nWhich crimes will you prioritise? Sexual offences, violent crime, shoplifting and anti-social behaviour.\\nHow will you prevent more crime?\\nHow will you prevent more crime? The clue is in the name of our initiative, More Police Officers for Thames Valley.\\nHow will you solve more crime?\\nHow will you solve more crime? More police officers will be able to solve more crime. It's not complicated.\\nWill officers notice a change?\\nWill officers notice a change? Yes. Experienced officers will get more responsibility and more autonomy to address the crimes that matter to their local communities. Newer officers will be subject to enhanced vetting, so we get the right people doing this critically important job.\\nIs the position unnecessarily politicised?\\nIs the position unnecessarily politicised? It's totally inappropriate to have a Conservative, Labour or Lib Dem person in charge of setting the policing priorities for our local area. We need a local, politically neutral candidate who has listened to local people. Another thing to remember is that in the last election for Police and Crime Commissioner, the turnout in the Thames Valley was just 35.8 per cent, meaning that 1,173,265 people in our area lost their opportunity to vote at this really important election.\\nWhere would you spend more money?\\nWhere would you spend more money? On more police officers investigating serious crimes such as sexual offences.\\nHow would you ensure budget cuts do not lead to crime rising?\\nHow would you ensure budget cuts do not lead to crime rising? My radical budget cuts relating to the costs of running the office of the PCC will make no difference to crime whatsoever. I will not be cutting funds to frontline policing.\\nHow important is the police's relationship with the public and how will you develop this?\\nHow important is the police's relationship with the public and how will you develop this? The police's relationship with the public is fundamental to effective policing. I think at the very least, local people need to know who their local police officers are.\\nHow will you ensure TVP deals with officers who commit crimes?\\nHow will you ensure TVP deals with officers who commit crimes? Before thinking about anything else, it's critical that we don't let dodgy officers in in the first place. Standards need to be raised and vetting needs to be greatly improved.\\nHow you make sure everywhere in the large Thames Valley area is represented?\\nHow you make sure everywhere in the large Thames Valley area is represented? I will be talking to local people in each area directly to establish the priorities for their local areas, as well as coordinating with local councils and community organisations etc.\\nHow will we be able to measure your success after your first 100 days?\\nHow will we be able to measure your success after your first 100 days? Very simply, less money being spent on the office of the PCC, and more money being spent on real policing.\", 'word_count': 729, 'is_opinion': False, 'twitter_account': None, 'all_links': ['https://www.bucksfreepress.co.uk/news/24245184.tory-thames-valley-police-commissioner-candidate-matthew-barber/', 'https://www.newsquest.co.uk', 'https://www.newsquest.co.uk/terms-conditions/', 'https://www.bucksfreepress.co.uk/news/24243579.thames-valley-police-crime-commissioner-election-explained/', 'https://www.bucksfreepress.co.uk/news/24243162.thames-valley-police-commissioner-candidate-russell-fowler/', 'https://www.newsquest.co.uk/contributor-terms/', 'https://www.newsquest.co.uk/terms-of-advertising/', 'https://www.newsquest.co.uk/diversity-statement/', 'https://newsquest.newsprints.co.uk/', 'https://www.newsquestprinting.co.uk/', 'https://www.bucksfreepress.co.uk/news/24244741.labour-thames-valley-police-commissioner-candidate-tim-starkey/', 'https://www.facebook.com/readingchronicle', 'https://www.newsquest.co.uk/cookie-policy/', 'https://www.bucksfreepress.co.uk/news/24246075.meet-lib-dem-thames-valley-police-commissioner-candidate-tim-bearder/', 'https://www.exchangeandmart.co.uk/', 'https://docs.piano.io/callbacks/#activeevent', 'https://www.newsquest.co.uk/privacy-policy/', 'http://www.twitter.com/https://twitter.com/CharlieSmithNQ', 'https://twitter.com/rdgchronicle'], 'all_domain_links': ['facebook.com', 'twitter.com', 'piano.io', 'newsprints.co.uk', 'exchangeandmart.co.uk', 'newsquestprinting.co.uk', 'bucksfreepress.co.uk', 'newsquest.co.uk'], 'id': 'cbcd35236b7751bef65a901350db91dd', 'score': 25.670425}\n"
